# Monopoly
A functioning monopoly simulation to compare strategies for bots

The code is written in python, using the GUI pygame 

I have done a fair amount offline; the starting point now is:
 - there can be up to 6 "players" (bots);
 - there is a running commentary printed to the IDE;
 - players will buy property whenever possible;
 - all community chest and chance cards are included (though a few are yet to be fully functioning);
 - all rent amounts are included in the set-up, even though house purchase isn't yet built in;
 - three-turn jail limit is functioning.
 
Things yet to be introduced/improved on the logical/gameplay are:
 - roll doubles allows roll again, and then three doubles sends to jail;
 - house purchasing;
 - mortgaging;
 - trading;
 - choice of strategies - property purchase choices, trading, houses

Things yet to be introduced/improved on the layout are numerous!

I am going to start out by improving programmer readability first; I hope that by adding comments and notes more people will be able to read and understand my code.

Many thanks for reading,

Matt
